GitHub Analyzer is a modern web app that explores and visualizes GitHub user profiles in a clean, interactive way. It helps you quickly understand user stats, repositories, and activity using a smooth glassmorphism-inspired interface.

This project is built as both a practical tool and a learning playground for experimenting with frontend development, API integration, and UI design.
